# Facade Design Pattern

## Concept
The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Real-world Analogy
A customer service department. When you call a company, you talk to a customer service representative (the facade). They handle your request by talking to the billing department, the technical support department, or the shipping department. You don't need to know the internal structure of the company or talk to each department individually.

## Key Features
- **Simplification**: Provides a simple interface to a complex system.
- **Decoupling**: Decouples the client from the complex subsystem.
- **Layering**: Can be used to layer your application.

## When to use
- When you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
- When you want to layer your subsystems.
